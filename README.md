## Installation

We recommend using Composer for installation and update management. To add CRM GoPay extension to your [REMP CRM](https://github.com/remp2020/crm-skeleton/) application use following command:

```bash
composer require remp/crm-gopay-module
```

Enable installed extension in your `app/config/config.neon` file:

```neon
extensions:
	# ...
	gopay: Crm\GoPayModule\DI\GoPayModuleExtension
```

Seed GoPay payment gateway and its configuration:

```bash
php bin/command.php application:seed
```

## Configuration & API keys

Enter GoPay API keys to CRM

   - Visit to CRM admin Payments settings (`/admin/config-admin` - Payments)
